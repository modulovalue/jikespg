/// This procedure, PARTSET, is invoked to apply a heuristic of the
/// Optimal Partitioning algorithm to a COLLECTION of subsets.  The
/// size of each subset in COLLECTION is passed in a parallel vector:
/// ELEMENT_SIZE. Let SET_SIZE be the length of the bit_strings used
/// to represent the subsets in COLLECTION, the universe of the
/// subsets is the set of integers: [1..SET_SIZE].
/// The third argument, LIST, is a vector identifying the order in
/// which the subsets in COLLECTION must be processed when they are
/// output.
/// The last two arguments, START and STACK are output parameters.
/// We recall that the output of Optimal Partitioning is two vectors:
/// a BASE vector and a RANGE vector...  START is the base vector.
/// It is used to indicate the starting position in the range
/// vector for each subset.  When a subset shares elements with
/// another subset, this is indicated by in index in START being
/// negative.  START also contains an extra "fence" element.  I.e.,
/// it has one more element than COLLECTION.
/// STACK is a vector used to construct a partition of the elements
/// of COLLECTION. That partition is used later (in ctabs or tabutil)
/// to output the final range vector...
///
///
/// We first merge all sets that are identical.  A hash table is used
/// to keep track of subsets that have already been seen.
/// DOMAIN_TABLE is used as the base of the hash table.  DOMAIN_LINK
/// is used to link subsets that collided.
///
/// The next step is to partition the unique subsets in the hash
/// table based on the number of elements they contain.  The vector
/// PARTITION is used for that purpose.
///
/// Finally, we attempt to overlay as many subsets as possible by
/// performing the following steps:
///
/// 1) Choose a base set in the partition with the largest subsets
///    and push it into a stack. (using the vector STACK)
///
/// 2) Iterate over the remaining non_empty elements of the partitions
///    in decreasing order of the size of the subsets contained in the
///    element in question. If there exists a subset in the element
///    which is a subset of the subset on top of the stack, currently
///    being constructed, remove it from the partition, and push it
///    into the stack. Repeat step 2 until the partition is empty.
